For the challenge portion I upgraded the game in several ways, here is the rundown:

STYLE
-Increased game and block size to make it last longer + be more visible
-Moved around buttons and increased Socre counter to improve the UI a bit
-Added a message feature that reports new points that were awarded and cheats that were activated

GAME ELEMENTS
-Added new "Bomb Cheat", which lets you pay 500 points in exchange for your next piece becoming a bomb
-The bomb piece will blow up a 5x5 square of blocks around the bomb blocks when it lands
